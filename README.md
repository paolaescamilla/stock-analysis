# Green Stock Analysis for 2017 and 2018

## Overview

### Purpose 

The purpose of this analysis is to support Steve with an in depth view of the daily volume of stocks for 2017 and 2018 in order for him to offer an investment recommendation to his parents.

### Background

Steve was having some difficulty to create and run formulas in such a large and complex set of data. For this reason, the tool VBA from Excel was used in order to create a code to automize the formulas, therefore simplifying the analysis and review task.

## Results

By creating a code, completely focused on the information provided by Steve, we were able to get the following results:  

### For year 2017:

- Ticker DQ was the best option for investment this year. 
- Ticker SEDG and ENPH also performed splendidly. 
- Ticker TERP was not a suitable option for investment.


### For the year 2018:

INSERT IMAGE 2018

- The performance of all tickers changed notoriously. Tickers DQ and SEDG performed negatively for its investors.
- Even though ENPH decreased its return this year, it was able to bring positive return for its investors.
- Ticker RUN, which did not excelled in return in 2017, positions itself in year 2018 by giving a return to investors of 84%


The recommendation for Steve is to reconsider his initial proposal to his parents of investing in DQ. 

Even though the ticker performed magnificently in 2017 the fact that by 2018 it decreased 82% tells us the high volatility and risk that it encompasses.

It would be suggested for Steve to explore further tickers ENPH and RUN. For the first, the return in 2018 was lower than the one given in 2017 however it was still a positive return. For the later, in year 2017 it only offer 5% return but for 2018 the value increased greatly to offer 84% return to investors.


## Summary

### Refactoring code

While doing this analysis, it was very useful to refer back to previous exercises for reference. This helped simplify the task of reinventing a code that already existed.

The main disadvantage perceived is that by using a previous code one can easily drag mistakes and it could be complicated to locate the error for adjustment. One definitely must know what is looking for in order to not get confused.


### Refactoring VBA script

The advantages of refactoring VBA script was that I was able to begin quickly as I have a reference guiding me. As said in the previous section, it can save a lot of time formulating the code by just looking at previous similar work done.

The main disadvantage found is that it is easy to drag mistakes. It can also be confusing the process of readapting the VBA script to your context (to your data set).
